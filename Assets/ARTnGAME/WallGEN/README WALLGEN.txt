WallGEN - Procedural wall generator

This is the very first version of the bonus WallGEN module that can create walls on the fly.
The idea behind this module is the creation of nice walls to plant Ivy on, currently for demo
images and later for production in games.

This system is under heavy work in progress and is not yet ready for production, it will be updated
and refined in upcoming updates of the Ivy Studio system until is perfected and out of the early 
development stages.
